# Codefighters
An Open-src collaborative development project led by myself and a team of Oxford Brookes University
Contributors.

## How do I Codefight?
~~Good question.~~
No really, the current implementation ideal is to have two stickmen ( very artsy.. ) battle it out
in a one-on-one fight for glory, except for one slight caveat...

**You fight _with_ code**

### What lanuages do you test?
We currently are planning on supporting C++, Python and Java, the questions themselves will be a
diplomatic concoction of both human made questions along with AI generated ones leveraging OpenAI's
ChatGPT generative API.
